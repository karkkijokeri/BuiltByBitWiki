# What is the art of "creating setups"?
Hello everyone! I'm ArrowTan, a Setup Specialist. I've been creating Minecraft Server Setups since 2021 December and I'm here to share with you some important information every Setup Specialist needs to know.
Let's get Started!
These are the following things you need to know.
1. Dependencies
2. File Size
3. Resource Description
4. Premium Plugins
5. Resource Support
6. Resell/Redistribution Rights

1. Dependencies
So, what are dependencies?
They are extra resources that are needed to run the Server Setup.
For Example, I'm sure you've heard of Citizens or Citizens2. They are used for creating NPCs with which you could do a lot of stuff like adding commands, adding skins to it, making it talk with players, etc etc.
Why am I talking about Citizens/Citizens2? 
Because it's to be put out separately as a dependency. The Plugin Author had revoked perms to redistribute the resource so You are to just put a link to the download source in the dependencies slot which you can find on the Add Resource Page.
This doesn't mean Free Plugins cannot be included in the dependencies slot.
Any resource you wish to add in that slot can be added but make sure it isn't included in the Download file

2. File Size
So, What is File Size?
File Size is basically the size of the Download file that other Users will download.
Why am I talking about File Size?
I've seen a few authors have issues with large download files and have no idea what to do.
The only solutions to beat that issue are the following
Delete some of the Plugins and add them as dependencies.
Delete the extra Files that aren't needed aka Logs, Spigot.yml, eula.txt, libraries, World, Nether and The End.
You can also reduce the region files in the world file to remove unneeded chunks using MCASelector (https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector).

3. Resource Description
So, what's a Resource Description?
Well, it's a description authors add to their resources where Users interested in the Resource can have a proper look at it.
Many Authors just add Images and Publish their Resources while others add No Images which isn't really a great thing as Many Users just skim through the resource and look at the pictures before anything else.
To Prevent any outcome of having 0 Buyers, it's best to add both Images and Proper Written text in the Description.
If you're looking for an Example then you can view this amazing Earth-SMP (https://builtbybit.com/resources/earth-smp-custom-texture-packs-more.23633/) Setup where the author decided to add the text info into the Pictures and add them to the description which makes it clean and attractive!

4. Premium Plugins
So, What are Premium Plugins?
Premium Plugins are those Plugins that aren't Published for Free but are to be paid to be downloaded.
First of all, Please never download Plugins from leaked sites and include them in the download file as they will get you banned straight away.
If you did buy a Plugin from SpigotMC or Mc-Market/BuiltByBit then you may use them but beware to not include them in the download file as it's not allowed to redistribute them.
There's a very rare chance Authors might allow you to redistribute Premium Plugins in your Setups but I've never seen 1 like those yet.
Also, Make sure that you're allowed to resell its config as some Plugin Authors do not even allow Users to include any part of their Plugins in their Resources.
This is also very similar to the Dependencies, If you're allowed to resell the Plugin's Config then you can include the config in the Download File whereas putting the link for Purchase in the Dependencies slot.

5. Resource Support
So, What does Resource Support Mean?
Well, it basically means that you're providing support for your Buyers/Downloaders.
To be honest, this is completely your choice, you can just include in the description saying you're not providing any support so Users can get that info noted before Messaging you on-site regarding it.
However, if you wish to provide support the following are some ways you can provide support in.
-> Discord Server (Really Helpful as its kinda like live chat and you can create separate channels for like README, FAQ, or Announcements and etc etc.
-> Telegram (Pretty similar, never used it but people prefer it)
-> Email (Not used by many users but sure its a alright method)
-> On-Site PMs (Really Useful but not that comfortable but its better than Email)

6. Resell/Redistribution Rights
What are Resell/Redistribution Rights?
Well, they are some rights that are taken way seriously on BuiltByBit.
These rights are mostly applied to Already Published Resources, Free Builds online, and a lot more!
If you're using an already Published resource from BuiltByBit then make sure you're allowed to use it as some authors do not allow the use of it.
There's not much to explain about this as it's mostly related to Dependencies and Premium Plugins.
Please always make sure the author allows your usage before using it as it can be a really huge issue after you've been caught for using a resource you weren't allowed to.
